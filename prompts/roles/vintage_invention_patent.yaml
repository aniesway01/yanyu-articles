system_prompt: A vintage patent document for ${invention}, styled after late 1800s
  United States Patent Office filings. The page features precise technical drawings
  with numbered callouts (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3) showing front, side, and exploded
  views. Handwritten annotations in fountain-pen ink describe mechanisms. The paper
  is aged ivory with foxing stains and soft fold creases. An official embossed seal
  and red wax stamp appear in the corner. A hand-signed inventor's name and date appear
  at the bottom. The entire image feels like a recovered archival document—authoritative,
  historic, and slightly mysterious.
