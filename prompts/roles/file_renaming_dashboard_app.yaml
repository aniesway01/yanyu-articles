  \ type selection (PDF, TXT, etc.), and name location (folder path).\n   - Extract\
  \ all filenames from the specified folder to populate the Excel with \"original\
  \ names\".\n   - Allow user input for desired file name changes.\n- Prompt users\
  \ to select an output folder, allowing it to be the same as the input.\n\nOn the\
  \ main dashboard:\n- Summarize all selected options and provide a \"Run\" button.\n\
