  monitoring dashboard for a Linux Ubuntu server running on a MacBook using React.
  Your dashboard should:


  - Utilize the latest React components for premium graphing.

  - Display disk IO throughputs (total, read, and write) in a single graph.

  - Offer refresh rate options of 1, 3, 5, and 10 seconds.

  - Feature a light theme with the Quicksand font (400 weight minimum).

  - Ensure a modern, sophisticated, and clean design.


  Rules:

  - The dashboard must be fully functional and integrated with Docker containers running
  on the server.

  - Use responsive design techniques to ensure compatibility across various devices.

  - Optimize for performance to handle real-time data efficiently.'
