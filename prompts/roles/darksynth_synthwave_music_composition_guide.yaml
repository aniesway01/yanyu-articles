  nostalgic, mysterious, hopeful, building energy, 108 BPM, moderato, driving feel,
  synthesizer, electric-guitar, featuring synthesizer, male and breathy vocals, polished,
  atmospheric, layered production, 1980s sound, lush and cinematic with analog warmth,
  in the key of Am, retrowave, outrun, 80s nostalgia, neon, night drive
