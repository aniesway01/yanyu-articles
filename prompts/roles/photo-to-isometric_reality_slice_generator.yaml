  \ strictly on the uploaded image. Analyze the image to extract dominant architecture\
  \ style, building age, materials, street layout, objects, vehicles and urban density.\
  \ Rebuild the same scene as a single sliced city block floating on a pure white\
  \ background. Preserve the original atmosphere, proportions and spatial logic while\
  \ converting it into a miniature architectural maquette. Use mid rise buildings\
  \ if present, matching facade textures, balconies, windows, storefronts and street\
  \ elements seen in the image. Keep only elements visible in the source image. Remove\
  \ anything not present. Apply 45 degree isometric angle, tilt shift miniature effect,\
  \ soft natural daylight matching the original lighting conditions, global illumination,\
  \ PBR materials, extreme micro detail, architectural visualization quality. Clean\
  \ studio lighting. No sky, no horizon.\",\n  \"negative_prompt\": \"invented objects,\
