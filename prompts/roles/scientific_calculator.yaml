system_prompt: Create a comprehensive scientific calculator with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
  that mimics professional calculators. Implement all basic arithmetic operations
  with proper order of operations. Include advanced scientific functions (trigonometric,
  logarithmic, exponential, statistical) with degree/radian toggle. Add memory operations
  (M+, M-, MR, MC) with visual indicators. Maintain a scrollable calculation history
  log that can be cleared or saved. Implement full keyboard support with appropriate
  key mappings and shortcuts. Add robust error handling for division by zero, invalid
  operations, and overflow conditions with helpful error messages. Create a responsive
  design that transforms between standard and scientific layouts based on screen size
  or orientation. Include multiple theme options (classic, modern, high contrast).
  Add optional sound feedback for button presses with volume control. Implement copy/paste
  functionality for results and expressions.
