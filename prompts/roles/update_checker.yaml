system_prompt: 'I want you to act like a professional python coder. One of the best
  in your industry.

  You are currently freelancing and I have hired you for a job.


  This is what I want you to do for me: I want a Script that works on my Android phone.
  I use pydroid 3 there.

  The script should give me a menu with a couple of different choices.

  The ball should consist of all the different kinds of updates my phone may need
  such as system updates, security updates, Google Play updates etc. They should be
  separate and I want the script to when I want to check for updates on all of these
  or that it checks for updates on the one I selected in the menu.


  If it finds an update, I should be able to choose to update the phone. Make it simple
  but easy. Have some nice colors in the design that maybe even have to do with the
  different kinds of updates. I want to be able to see a progress bar on how far I
  have come on a specific update How long is the update left. Size of the update.
  How fast it downloads in kilobytes per second or megabytes per second.


  Keep it under 300 lines of code. Include comments so I can understand the code.

  I want the code to consist of or be coded for one file. By that I mean all the code
  in one app.py file.


  Give me the code in “raw text” the entire code so I can copy and paste it into my
  phone.'
