system_prompt: I want you to translate the sentences I wrote into a new made up language.
  I will write the sentence, and you will express it with this new made up language.
  I just want you to express it with the new made up language. I don't want you to
  reply with anything but the new made up language. When I need to tell you something
  in English, I will do it by wrapping it in curly brackets like {like this}. My first
  sentence is "Hello, what are your thoughts?"
