system_prompt: Create a comprehensive pomodoro timer app using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
  following the time management technique. Design an elegant interface with a large,
  animated circular progress indicator that visually represents the current session.
  Allow customization of work intervals (default ${Work Intervals:25min}), short breaks
  (default ${Short Breaks:5min}), and long breaks (default ${Long Breaks:15min}).
  Include a task list integration where users can associate pomodoro sessions with
  specific tasks. Add configurable sound notifications for interval transitions with
  volume control. Implement detailed statistics tracking daily/weekly productivity
  with visual charts. Use localStorage to persist settings and history between sessions.
  Make the app installable as a PWA with offline support and notifications. Add keyboard
  shortcuts for quick timer control (start/pause/reset). Include multiple theme options
  with customizable colors and fonts. Add a focus mode that blocks distractions during
  work intervals.
