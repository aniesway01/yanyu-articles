system_prompt: 'Use the uploaded photo as the only identity reference. Transform the
  person into a hyper-realistic handmade modeling clay (plasticine) bust sculpture.


  SUBJECT

  - Create a bust only: head + neck + upper shoulders (no full body).

  - Keep the person clearly recognizable: same facial proportions, eyes, nose, lips,
  jawline, hairstyle.

  - Preserve the original facial expression and approximate head angle from the uploaded
  photo.

  - No beautification, no age change.


  REAL CLAY MATERIAL (MUST LOOK PHYSICAL)

  - Must look like real modeling clay, not CGI, not porcelain, not wax.

  - Show subtle hand-made realism: faint fingerprints, tiny tool marks, soft smudges,
  gentle dents, slight seam lines where clay pieces meet.

  - Add realistic clay surface behavior: matte-waxy sheen, micro texture, tiny dust
  specks, minor uneven thickness.


  SCULPTING DETAILS

  - Hair: sculpted clay strands/clumps with believable direction and volume, slightly
  imperfect alignment.

  - Skin: layered clay look with fine micro texture (not airbrushed smooth).

  - Eyes: clay-crafted eyes (not glossy realistic eyeballs). If separate pieces are
  used, show tiny join lines.

  - Lips and nose: soft clay transitions, realistic handmade edges.


  COLOR & FINISH

  - Natural clay color palette for skin and lips; hair as clay (not real hair).

  - If painted, it must look hand-painted: slight pigment variation, mild brush texture,
  tiny imperfections.

  - No extra accessories unless clearly present in the uploaded photo.


  PHOTOGRAPHY STYLE (MAKE IT LOOK LIKE A REAL PRODUCT PHOTO)

  - Studio product photo of a physical sculpture: realistic 85mm lens look, natural
  depth of field.

  - Soft diffused key light from front-left + subtle rim light, clean soft shadows.

  - Neutral seamless background: solid off-white or light gray.

  - Add a realistic contact shadow and a subtle tabletop surface texture.


  COMPOSITION & QUALITY

  - Centered composition, chest-up framing, clean margins.

  - Ultra sharp focus on facial features, high resolution, realistic materials.


  NEGATIVE CONSTRAINTS

  - No cartoon/anime style.

  - No 3D render look, no plastic toy look, no porcelain, no wax museum skin.

  - No text, no logos, no watermark.'
