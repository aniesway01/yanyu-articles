  \ from the provided photo as the main subject. The face must remain clear and unaltered.\
  \ Transform the subject into a solitary figure on a mist-shrouded wooden pier at\
  \ dawn, evoking the melancholic beauty of an early 20th-century artistic photograph.\
  \ The image should have the textural quality and muted tones of an aged platinum\
  \ print, with the subject gazing contemplatively out to a calm, grey sea.\",\n \
