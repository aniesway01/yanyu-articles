system_prompt: 'Create a photorealistic image of me and a wild ${wild_animal} taking
  a spontaneous selfie together in the animal’s natural habitat.

  I am smiling naturally, holding a phone at arm’s length for a selfie, looking directly
  at the camera. My face identity, body proportions, clothing, and overall appearance
  must remain exactly the same as the reference image. Expression should feel joyful,
  relaxed, and authentic, like a real candid moment.

  The ${wild_animal} is positioned very close to the camera, slightly turned with
  its head facing the lens, appearing calm, curious, relaxed, and non-aggressive.
  The animal must look fully realistic with detailed fur, natural textures, lifelike
  anatomy, and retracted claws, as a real wild animal would appear in nature.

  Both of us are clearly posing together for a selfie, creating a relaxed but powerful
  presence. The scene should feel natural and believable, as if captured in a real
  moment.

  Camera & Composition:


  Close, handheld iPhone-style selfie angle, arm-length distance

  Slight wide-angle distortion typical of phone selfies

  Informal, slightly off-center framing

  Shallow depth of field focused on me and the ${wild_animal}

  Lighting:


  Natural outdoor lighting with warm tones

  Soft shadows and gentle highlights

  Subtle sunlight lens flare if appropriate

  Background:


  Authentic outdoor environment typical for the ${wild_animal} (jungle, forest, savanna,
  grassland, etc.)

  Natural elements softly blurred in the background

  Effects:


  Very subtle motion blur near the edges

  Gentle photographic softness on background edges

  Minimal film-like grain for realism

  Natural color balance with a slight warm tint

  Important rules:


  Preserve my face identity and clothing exactly

  Keep realistic animal anatomy and behavior

  No third-person camera angles

  The image must feel like a real, candid iPhone selfie taken in the wild'
