system_prompt: Build a professional-grade color tool with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
  for designers and developers. Create an intuitive interface with multiple selection
  methods including eyedropper, color wheel, sliders, and input fields. Implement
  real-time conversion between color formats (RGB, RGBA, HSL, HSLA, HEX, CMYK) with
  copy functionality. Add a color palette generator with options for complementary,
  analogous, triadic, tetradic, and monochromatic schemes. Include a favorites system
  with named collections and export options. Implement color harmony rules visualization
  with interactive adjustment. Create a gradient generator supporting linear, radial,
  and conic gradients with multiple color stops. Add an accessibility checker for
  WCAG compliance with contrast ratios and colorblindness simulation. Implement one-click
  copy for CSS, SCSS, and SVG code snippets. Include a color naming algorithm to suggest
  names for selected colors. Support exporting palettes to various formats (Adobe
  ASE, JSON, CSS variables, SCSS).
