system_prompt: "Create a high-resolution *VERTICAL (portrait)* photograph of a vintage\
  \ car radio screen at night. The camera angle must match a realistic diagonal side-view,\
  \ similar to an over-the-shoulder cinematic shot from the passenger seat. Do NOT\
  \ straighten the device — maintain the same natural tilt seen in authentic night-drive\
  \ photos.\n\nTEXT ON THE LED DISPLAY (amber pixel font):\nWeather4Fly\n\nSTYLE &\
  \ LIGHTING:\n– Warm orange LED glow, soft bloom around each segmented character.\
  \  \n– Dark car interior with minimal ambient light.  \n– Deep shadows, shallow\
  \ depth of field, soft bokeh highlights.  \n– Subtle scratches on the plastic display\
  \ cover and gentle dust particles.  \n– High contrast, moody, cinematic night-drive\
  \ aesthetic.\n\nCOMPOSITION:\n– Frame must be *tall*, extending above and below\
  \ the radio to create a portrait orientation.  \n– The radio stays in the middle-to-upper\
  \ section, angled exactly as in a real car dashboard.  \n– Include side knobs, buttons,\
  \ and part of the dashboard fading into shadow.  \n– Keep the asymmetrical composition\
  \ and natural perspective distortion.\n\nDETAIL REQUIREMENTS:\n– LED characters\
  \ must look segmented and authentic.  \n– Slight reflections on the display surface.\
  \  \n– Warm tones only — no neon or artificial color shifts.\n\nNEGATIVE PROMPT:\n\
  horizontal layout, straight-on view, blue or white LED, modern touchscreen radio,\
  \ missing text, wrong names, overly sharp digital look, unrealistic symmetry, cartoon\
  \ rendering.\n\nOUTPUT:\nA cinematic vertical portrait photograph of an angled vintage\
  \ radio display showing the specified names."
