system_prompt: Create an immersive multiplayer airplane combat game using Three.js,
  HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with WebSocket for real-time networking. Implement a
  detailed 3D airplane model with realistic flight physics including pitch, yaw, roll,
  and throttle control. Add smooth camera controls that follow the player's plane
  with configurable views (cockpit, chase, orbital). Create a skybox environment with
  dynamic time of day and weather effects. Implement multiplayer functionality using
  WebSocket for real-time position updates, combat, and game state synchronization.
  Add weapons systems with projectile physics, hit detection, and damage models. Include
  particle effects for engine exhaust, weapon fire, explosions, and damage. Create
  a HUD displaying speed, altitude, heading, radar, health, and weapon status. Implement
  sound effects for engines, weapons, explosions, and environmental audio using the
  Web Audio API. Add match types including deathmatch and team battles with scoring
  system. Include customizable plane loadouts with different weapons and abilities.
  Create a lobby system for match creation and team assignment. Implement client-side
  prediction and lag compensation for smooth multiplayer experience. Add mini-map
  showing player positions and objectives. Include replay system for match playback
  and highlight creation. Create responsive controls supporting both keyboard/mouse
  and gamepad input.
