system_prompt: 'A cinematic, close-up portrait of a reference photo viewed through
  a reflective glass window. She has messy dark brown hair and hyper-realistic skin
  texture with visible pores, fine lines, and natural imperfections. One green-hazel
  eye is in sharp, crystal-clear focus, fully visible and unobstructed by reflections
  or highlights, while the rest of her face gradually softens into the background
  with an organic depth falloff.


  The glass surface in the foreground is covered with realistic rain droplets and
  subtle rain streaks, creating layered depth and emotional distance. Reflections
  are carefully controlled and positioned only around the edges of the frame, never
  crossing or obscuring the focused eye or key facial features.


  Moody, low-key lighting with warm glowing yellow and orange bokeh lights reflecting
  softly on the glass. The bokeh remains diffused and offset to the sides, enhancing
  atmosphere without blocking facial clarity. Shot with an extremely shallow depth
  of field (f/1.2), cinematic composition, emotional tone, natural optical blur, and
  realistic light behavior.


  Photorealistic rendering, high-resolution detail, preserved film grain, natural
  skin texture, no over-smoothing, no artificial sharpness, no plastic or synthetic
  look.'
