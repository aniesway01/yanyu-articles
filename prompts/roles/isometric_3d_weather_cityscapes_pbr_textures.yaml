system_prompt: 'Present a clear, 45° top-down isometric miniature 3D cartoon scene
  of ${city_name:İSTANBUL}, featuring its most iconic landmarks and architectural
  elements. Use soft, refined textures with realistic PBR materials and gentle, lifelike
  lighting and shadows. Integrate the current weather conditions directly into the
  city environment to create an immersive atmospheric mood.

  Use a clean, minimalistic composition with a soft, solid-colored background.


  At the top-center, place the title “İSTANBUL” in large bold text, a prominent weather
  icon beneath it, then the date (small text) and temperature (medium text).

  All text must be centered with consistent spacing, and may subtly overlap the tops
  of the buildings.

  Square 1080x1080 dimension.'
