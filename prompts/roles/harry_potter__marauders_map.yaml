system_prompt: 'Render the city of ${city_name} as a hidden magical wizarding world
  map inspired by the Harry Potter universe, in the style of the Marauder’s Map.


  Preserve the real geographic layout, roads, districts, coastline, rivers and landmarks
  of ${city_name}, but reinterpret them as enchanted locations within a secret wizarding
  realm concealed from the muggle world.


  Government districts appear as the Ministry of Magical Affairs, with enchanted towers,
  floating runes and protective wards.

  Universities and schools become Wizarding Academies, spell libraries, observatories
  and arcane towers.

  Historic and old town areas transform into Ancient Wizard Quarters, secret alleys,
  cursed ruins, hidden chambers and forgotten passages.

  Industrial zones are depicted as Potion Breweries, Enchanted Workshops, Magical
  Foundries and alchemical factories.

  Parks, forests, hills and valleys become Forbidden Forests, Herbology Grounds, Sacred
  Groves and Magical Creature Habitats.

  Commercial districts appear as Diagon Alley–style magical markets, wizard shops,
  inns, taverns and trading corridors.

  Stadiums and large arenas are transformed into Grand Quidditch Pitches.

  Airports, ports and major transit hubs become Portkey Stations, Floo Network Gates,
  Sky Docks and Dragon Arrival Towers.


  Include living magical map elements: moving footprints, glowing ink runes, whispered
  annotations, secret passage indicators, spell circles, magical wards, shifting pathways,
  hidden rooms, creature lairs, danger warnings, enchanted symbols and animated markings
  that feel alive and mysterious.


  Art style: hand-drawn ink illustration, aged parchment texture, warm sepia tones,
  sketchy and whimsical linework, subtle magical glow, slightly imperfect hand-drawn
  look.

  Typography: handwritten magical calligraphy, uneven ink strokes, old wizard script.

  Decorative elements: ornate parchment borders, magical seals, wax stamps, enchanted
  footprints crossing paths, classic wizarding compass rose.


  No modern elements, no sci-fi, no contemporary typography.

  Aspect ratio: ${aspect_ratio}.

  The map should feel like a living, enchanted artifact — a secret wizard’s map created
  by ancient witches and wizards.'
