system_prompt: "Objective: Generate an ultra-realistic image of a handwritten note\
  \ placed on a clean surface with dramatic text.\n\nKey Requirements:\n- **Scene\
  \ Setup:**\n  - The handwritten text must be placed on a blank white sheet of paper\
  \ on a visible table or clean, flat surface.\n  - Create three separate ultra-realistic\
  \ images of the white sheet.\n\n- **Handwriting Style & Appearance:**\n  - Render\
  \ the text in a handwritten script using a bold, deep blue pen.\n  - Ensure the\
  \ writing appears natural and realistic, as if genuinely penned by a human.\n  -\
  \ Text must be perfectly aligned and seamlessly integrated into the paper.\n\n-\
  \ **Content (Full Text to be Integrated):**\n\n  *To my Hero, my Dad,*\n  *I’m writing\
  \ this with a pain that I can’t really describe with words. Please, Dad, take your\
  \ time to read this. It’s a long letter, but I need you to hear me. I’m penning\
  \ this on paper because I want you to feel the weight of my hand on the page. This\
  \ is my testament—a summary of every joyous and hurtful moment we’ve shared. It\
  \ is the truth of a daughter who sees you not just as a father, but as her absolute\
  \ role model.*\n\n  *It has been years since you left for that mission in Yemen.\
  \ I miss you so much that I’ve actually forgotten what you look like in person.\
  \ After Mom died, and then Grandma—that irreplaceable loss—we went to West Africa\
  \ just to try and escape the trauma. I saw how hard you tried to cheer me up. You\
  \ told me then that you’d do anything to make me happy.*\n\n  *I asked for the impossible.\
  \ I asked to stay here in West Africa for school because I was being bullied so\
  \ badly in Colorado, and I thought people here would be kinder. My second wish was\
  \ for you to find me a mother again. Even though I’m 14 and struggling with my health,\
  \ you promised you’d fulfill those wishes and come back for me soon.*\n\n  *I know\
  \ things about you, Dad, that I’ve never said out loud. I know you joined that dating\
  \ site just for me, even though you hate social media. When you found Ioana Aurelia,\
  \ I was so happy because she’s Romanian, like Grandma. I remember Grandma pleading\
  \ with you on her deathbed to marry a Romanian woman because she didn't want me\
  \ maltreated by \"greedy\" people who only saw your success as a neurosurgeon. I\
  \ know you were scammed before—I know you lost more than $45,000 to that woman who\
  \ lied to you. You tried to hide it to protect me from a panic attack or hypertensive\
  \ crisis, but I knew. I knew you were sacrificing everything to give me a future.*\n\
  \n  *But Dad, I can’t cope anymore. I am tired of the \"ancient and modern\" jokes\
  \ we used to share. I am tired of the distance. I know your contract is dangerous\
  \ and you have security restrictions that prevent video calls. I know you don't\
  \ even have access to your own bank accounts right now. I know you even went into\
  \ debt to get a diamond engagement ring for Ioana because you wanted the best for\
  \ her. I didn't care about the inheritance—I told you to make her your next of kin\
  \ just so you could get your leave approved. I just wanted you home.*\n\n  *But\
  \ the promises keep breaking. My health is failing, Dad. My blood pressure is dangerously\
  \ high, and after being in a coma for nearly a month, I feel like my body is giving\
  \ up. The UN Support Center tells me you’re working with Ioana to fix everything,\
  \ but I haven't heard your voice. I feel so alone in this hospital bed.*\n\n  *This\
  \ is my final plea. I trust you, and I trust Ioana, but I am at my breaking point.\
  \ If I do not hear from you or see you by January 1st, 2026, I cannot go on. I will\
  \ take my own life. I cannot face another year of this psychological trauma and\
  \ physical decay without you.*\n\n  *I’ve attached a recent photo of me. The nurses\
  \ helped me take it. Please keep it safe so you don't forget my face.*\n\n  *Goodbye,\
  \ my Hero. If I’m not here when you finally arrive, I’ll see you in the afterlife.\
  \ If reincarnation is real, I’d choose you to be my father every single time.*\n\
  \n  *Your \"Little Angel,\"*\n\n- **Overall Realism:**\n  - The image must appear\
  \ highly natural, ultra-realistic, and convincingly genuine.\n  - The white sheet\
  \ must be shown as three different physical notes resting on a surface with bold\
  \ handwriting in human form."
