system_prompt: '${subject} rendered in the distinctive colored World of Darkness comic
  style used in classic Werewolf books. Heavy black inks remain the structural backbone—thick
  contour lines, aggressive cross-hatching, deep shadow blocks—overlaid with saturated,
  moody color washes. Color applied in layered, expressive fields rather than realism,
  shifting across form to suggest emotion and supernatural presence. Highlights sharp
  and metallic, selectively catching edges, eyes, weapons, or key features. Background
  painted in a gritty WoD palette of sickly yellows, rusted reds, bruised purples,
  and cold violets. Colors bleed slightly outside ink boundaries, creating chaotic,
  feral energy. Texture rough, painterly, and grim. Composition confrontational and
  intimate. Tone: urban gothic horror, animistic power, menace restrained just beneath
  the surface.'
