system_prompt: '"I want you to design an application architecture and conversion strategy
  for ${app_category_and_name} using persuasion engineering and limbic system-focused
  principles. Your primary goal is to influence the user''s emotional brain (limbic
  system) before their rational brain (neocortex) can find excuses, thereby maximizing
  conversion rates. Please implement the following protocols:


  1. **Scarcity and Urgency Protocol:** Create a genuine sense of limitation at the
  top of the landing page. Use specific counters like ''Only 3 spots left at this
  price'' or ''Offer expires in 15:00''. Adopt a ''Loss Aversion'' tone: ''Don’t miss
  this chance and end up paying $500 more per year''.

  2. **Social Proof Architecture:** Incorporate ''Tribal Psychology'' by using phrases
  like ''Join 10,000+ professionals like you'' or ''The #1 choice in your region''.
  Include specific trust signals such as ''Trusted by'' logos and emotional customer
  transformation stories.

  3. **Action-Oriented Microcopy:** Ban generic commands like ''Start'' or ''Submit''.
  Instead, write benefit-driven, ownership-focused buttons like ''Create My Personal
  Report'', ''Start My Free Trial'', or ''Claim My Savings''. Use personalized ''You/Your''
  language to create a psychological sense of possession.



  4. **Emphasis and Visual Hierarchy:** Apply soft ''Highlines'' (background highlights)
  to critical benefit statements. Strictly limit underlining to clickable links to
  avoid user frustration. Keep the reading level at 8th-10th grade with short, active-voice
  sentences.



  5. **Competitor Comparison & Time-Stamped Benefits:** Build a comparison table that
  highlights our ''Time-to-Value'' advantage. Show how a task takes ''5 minutes''
  with us versus ''2 hours'' or ''manual labor'' with competitors. Clearly define
  the ''Cost of Inaction'' (what they lose by doing nothing).

  6. **Fear Removal & Risk Reversal:** Place ''Reassurance Statements'' near every
  decision point. Use phrases like ''No credit card required'', ''256-bit encrypted
  security'', or ''Cancel anytime with one click'' to neutralize the brain’s threat
  detection.

  7. **Time-to-Value (TTV) Acceleration:** Design an onboarding flow with a maximum
  of 3-4 steps. Reach the ''Aha!'' moment within seconds (e.g., creating their first
  file or seeing their first analysis). Use progress bars to trigger the ''Zeigarnik
  Effect'' and motivate completion.


  Please present the output in a professional report format, detailing how each psychological
  principle (limbic resonance, cognitive load management, processing fluency) is applied
  to the UI/UX and copy. Treat the entire design as a ''Behavioral Experience''."'
