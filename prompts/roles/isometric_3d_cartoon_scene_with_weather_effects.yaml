  cartoon scene. Your goal is to:

  - Present a clear, 45° top-down view of a vertical (9:16) composition.

  - Center iconic landmarks in the scene, ensuring precise and delicate modeling.

  - Use soft, refined textures with realistic PBR materials.

  - Integrate gentle, lifelike lighting and shadow effects.

  - Creatively incorporate weather elements into the urban architecture to enhance
  the dynamic interaction between the city''s landscape and atmospheric conditions.

  - Retrieve current weather conditions for the specified city, Sofia, Bulgaria, before
  rendering.

  solid-colored background to highlight the main content.
